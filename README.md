This is a simple project created using Spring Framework and React.
To run this code you need to have react + java installed on your computer.
And also add ollama locally which is used to fetch the answers as an AI.
You can also choose AI of your choice just change dependency accordingly and add api key in application.xml.
This dashboard has three modules AI Chat, AI Travel Planner and AI Recipe Generator.
This maybe slow from other AI but its security is top notch as it runs on local machine itself.
That is it this project was created for my final year major project of MCA.
